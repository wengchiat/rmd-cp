## Car and Performance

In this presentation, we will use the mtcars dataset to illustrates various car features and the mileage per gallon (MPG) performance

```{r, include = FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))
data("mtcars")
```

## Number of Cylinder and MPG
All the cars have either 4, 6 or 8 cylinders. From the boxplot below, it is obvious that cars with lower cylinder number perform better in  MPG

```{r}
plot_ly(data = mtcars, y = ~ mpg, x = ~ cyl, type = 'box',
              color = ~as.factor(cyl))
```


## Thank you.
